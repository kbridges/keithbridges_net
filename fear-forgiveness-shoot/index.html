					<h1>Shoot Concept Info</h1>
					<h2>Location:</h2>
					<p>Union 206 Studios</p>
					<p>350 Calvert Ave  Alexandria, VA 22301</p>
					<!--<h2>5:30pm - 9:30pm</h2> -->

				<div>
					<h2> </h2>
					<p><strong>Photographer: </strong>Keith Bridges</p>
					<p><strong>Shooting Assistant: </strong>Peter Carlson-Bancroft</p>
					<!--<p><strong>Production Assistant: </strong>Kaie Mattingly</p> -->
					<!--<p><strong>Model: </strong>Willow</p>

					<h2>Basic Concept</h2>
					<p>I am trying to get a serties of 5 images as a sequence.</p>
					<p>I am going to ID the 5 images:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>fear</li>
					<li>rage</li>
					<li>sadness</li>
					<li>resignation</li>
					<li>hope</li>
					</ul>
					
				</div>
				
				
				
				
				<div id="concept-images">
					<h2>Concept images:</h2>
					<p>These are all pretty crappy stock photos (some crappier than others). But they give you an idea of what I am looking for. I have notes below each image to explain my thinking a little.</p>
					<!--<p>Okay? Questions? give me a call (703) 336-3541</p>
					<p>So without futher ado... the sample images:</p> -->
				</div>
			
				<div class="sample-image">
					<h2>Fear 1</h2>
					<p><img src="_img/fear001.jpg" alt="fear 001"></p>
					<p>this is more about rough pose than anything else, sort of a seated/squatting position</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sample-image">
					<h2>Fear 2</h2>
					<p><img src="_img/fear002.jpg" alt="fear 002"></p>
					<p>same as above, the lighting is <em>close</em> but not what I am after... also, not trying to go so overtly sexy and i do want to see the subject's face.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sample-image">
					<h2>Fear 3</h2>
					<p><img src="_img/fear003.jpg" alt="fear 003"></p>
					<p>she does not look afraid enough in this shot, but we are getting there, the pose is closer, but not so coy</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sample-image">
					<h2>Rage 1</h2>
					<p><img src="_img/rage001.jpg" alt="rage 001"></p>
					<p>primal scream... good stuff more head and shoulders but definitely a profile shot</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sample-image">
					<h2>Rage 2</h2>
					<p><img src="_img/rage002.jpg" alt="rage 002"></p>
					<p>see above, I like her scream more, but I do want dark backgrounds</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sample-image">
					<h2>Rage 3</h2>
					<p><img src="_img/rage003.jpg" alt="rage 003"></p>
					<p>another good scream, I would kind of like to have eyes open though, I don't know if that is even possible</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sample-image">
					<h2>Rage 4</h2>
					<p><img src="_img/rage004.jpg" alt="rage 004"></p>
					<p>dark background is good, eyes open is good but that isn't really as much of a scream as a snarl, and I don't really want to have the all smudgy eye makeup</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sample-image">
					<h2>Sadness 1</h2>
					<p><img src="_img/sadness001.jpg" alt="sadness 001"></p>
					<p>jeeze, she looks so sad, and I like her looking down, and I like the dark background, my adjustment is the shooting angle, I want to be a little more above her looking down - and I'm not sure about the 3/4 profile, I am thinking more full front</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sample-image">
					<h2>Sadness 2</h2>
					<p><img src="_img/sadness002.jpg" alt="sadness 002"></p>
					<p>well, I do not like the fact that she has a black eye! definitely NOT going for violence in this - but the shooting angle is along the lines of what I want, I like that we can see her eyes, and I really like that she looks like she is about to cry, we can see her holding back the tears... </p>
				</div>
				<div class="sample-image">
					<h2>Sadness 3</h2>
					<p><img src="_img/sadness003.jpg" alt="sadness 003"></p>
					<p>I like seeing her eyes and her looking into the lens, she doesn't really look as sad as #2 does, but if we could see the verge of tears like #2 and if her head was tilted down a bit this would be money... the shooting angle is pretty close to what I want.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sample-image">
					<h2>Resignation 1</h2>
					<p><img src="_img/resignation001.jpg" alt="resignation 001"></p>
					<p>so here we have her back in the head-turned-profile thing, I like the positiion, but she looks a little too pissed off and I want dark backgrounds</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sample-image">
					<h2>Resignation 2</h2>
					<p><img src="_img/resignation002.jpg" alt="resignation 002"></p>
					<p>similiar idea here, a little too close in, I probably want to go a little wider than this and, I like the rim of light, but not as dark in the shadows</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sample-image">
					<h2>Resignation 3</h2>
					<p><img src="_img/resignation003.jpg" alt="resignation 003"></p>
					<p>pretty close as far as framing goes, but I don't want to go all sexy- but maybe this would be okay if she had the right expression on her face - think more along the lines of the brave face on the coach of the team that just lost.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sample-image">
					<h2>Hope 1</h2>
					<p><img src="_img/hope001.jpg" alt="hope 001"></p>
					<p>the expression on her face is nowhere near what I want, but the basic framing and shooting angle are close</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sample-image">
					<h2>Hope 2</h2>
					<p><img src="_img/hope002.jpg" alt="hope 002"></p>
					<p>whew... this is kinda rough, but the angle is okay- and if you can image her not squinting into the sun (who thought that was a good idea?) and not smiling that weird smile as much, then maybe we are approaching what I want- oh yeah, and a dark interior background... and... just more good...</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sample-image">
					<h2>Hope 3</h2>
					<p><img src="_img/hope003.jpg" alt="hope 003"></p>
					<p>this is the closest expression I could find- the angle is too sharp and the look on her face is too smug, but, there it is....</p>
				</div>
				
				
				
				<h2>Lighting and Treatment Examples</h2>
					<p>These are some imgages from my own portfolio that point toward the ideas I have for the lighting and deveolopment treatment.</p>
                    
                <div class="sample-image">
					<h2>Example 1</h2>
					<p><img src="_img/kbm-10769-7c_web.jpg" alt="example 001"></p>
					<p>these are is the best examples I have right now of the lighting and treatment I am thinking of using. My goal is to get the highlights somewhat brighter without killing the definition.</p>
				</div>
                
                <div class="sample-image">
					<h2>Example 2</h2>
					<p><img src="_img/kbm-10313-7c_web.jpg" alt="example 002"></p>
					<p>here's an image showing the same basic technique with the model in a seated position</p>
				</div>
                
				
				
				<h2>Wardrobe ideas:</h2>
					<p>I would like to try something white and "billowy" a little bit "flowy" - not too loose, but more importantly not <strong><em>too</em></strong> tight.</p>
					
					<h2>Hair ideas:</h2>
					<p>no ideas yet, other than natural, pretty and allowing some motion. </p>
					
					
					<h2>Makeup ideas:</h2>
					<p>I wopuld like your lips to be a richer-looking dark red. Other than that, simple, natural... like the hair- no agenda- ideas welcome.</p>
					
					<!--<h2>To Come:</h2>
					<p>Lighting diagrams <em><strong>- I have them with me</strong></em> </p> -->
					
                    <h2>Posing Models</h2>
					<p> these all leave something to be desired as far as facal expressions, and these guys have no cloths or hair, but these are a good guide</p>
					<div class="sample-image">
					<p><img src="_img/pose_fear.jpg" alt="fear"></p>
					<p><img src="_img/pose_rage.jpg" alt="rage"></p>
					<p><img src="_img/pose_sad.jpg" alt="sadness"></p>
					<p><img src="_img/pose_resignation.jpg" alt="resignation"></p>
					<p><img src="_img/pose_hope.jpg" alt="hope"></p>
